LIFX-Control-Panel is an open source application for controlling your LIFX brand lights. It integrates simple features, 
such as monitoring and changing bulb color, with more advanced ones, like Average Screen Color, Color Eyedropper, and more.

The application uses [mclarkk](https://github.com/mclarkk)'s [lifxlan](https://github.com/mclarkk/lifxlan) module to discover and send commands to the lights.

# Quick Start
Go over to [releases](https://github.com/samclane/LIFX-Control-Panel/releases) and download the latest `.exe` file.

Starting the program takes a moment, as it first must scan your LAN for any LIFX devices. 

# Running the source code
To run the code from source, simply run `python gui.pyw` from the command line

# Testing progress
I have currently only tested on the following operating systems:
* Windows 10

and on the following LIFX devices:
* LIFX A19 Firmware v2.75
* LIFX A13 Firmware v2.75
* LIFX Z   Firmware v1.22
